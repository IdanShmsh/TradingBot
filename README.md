# TradingBot
This is my attempt to create a python bot that can trade on forex pairs.

Currently the bot is trading based on ruleset logic using only a single ruleset. In the future, hopefully, I will be able to integrate a certain ai 
model to contribute to the analysis process which I am indeed working on.

Also, I decided that instead of using an api, like I should, I am using selenium to interact with the website plus500 to perform the actions of buying
and selling. So be whare of that if you're running the project it won't work.

In the current state of this project, while running the analyzer on historical data from the last 30 days, simulating real time trading, the bot made
250% profit. But when running the bot on actual real time data (on demo mode) it seemed to have made a loss in money.
If you really dive into this project, which I have no idea why you would, and find that you have an idea to make it actually profitable, even though
there's nothing stoping you from taking it and modifying it yourself (stealing it), I would really appreciate it if you contact me and maybe 
we can work together :)

Thank you for taking a look at this project!
